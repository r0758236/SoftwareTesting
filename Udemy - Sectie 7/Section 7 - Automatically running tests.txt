SECTION 7: Automatically running tests

tools:
- collection runner
- postman monitors
- newman
- newman + jenkins
- newman + other CI servers

1. postman collection runner

file > new runner tab

. environment
. iterations
. delay = interval il milliseconds
. logging responses
. data files

2. postman monitors

run collections at regular intervals
pro feature but you can use up to 1000 API calls per month free
overview of all monitors that you have

known limitations:
- postmane servers are not in the same network as you are
- cannot import global variables (but can create them if needed)
- global and environment variables are not persisted

. give monitor a name
. choose environment
. schedule (timer/minutes)
. regions

3. newman

why is automation important?
- by using automation you reduce repetitive manual work
- get INSTANT feedback when something does not work anymore
- identify software bugs early in the development process

intro to Nodejs & NPM

nodejs = a js runtime environment that can execute js without opening a browser
(newman runs inside the nodejs environment)
npm = node package manager 
> a repo of projects and has knowledge of what requirements each project has

what is newman?
a cli tool which allows you to run a postman collection directly from the command line
