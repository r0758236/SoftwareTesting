Mock server

- fake API that simulates a server response but tries to behave like a real API
- can be used to serve canned responses to specific requests

why use a mock server?

- API design, prototyping and development
- API testing
- for isolating external dependencies in the testing process

known limitations

- cannot match the body
- cannot match the query parameters
(GET /api/foo/2/?hidden=true)
(GET /api/foo/2/?hidden=false)
- request a specific response by sending a header
