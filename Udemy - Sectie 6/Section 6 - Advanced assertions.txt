steps to write assertions:
- parse the response body
- write a test


parsing the response body

response body type:
- json > pm.response.json() >> THE MOST COMMON
- xml > xml2json(responseBody)
- html > cheerio(pm.response.text())
- plain-text > pm.response.text()
- csv > csv-parse/lib/sync

assertions

So far we have only looked into the status code and the response body for writing tests. But you can also make assertions on the headers or cookies.

Headers
This is how you retrieve a header from the response:

pm.response.headers.get('X-Cache') 

and in a test:

Header exists: pm.response.to.have.header(X-Cache'); 

Header has value: pm.expect(pm.response.headers.get('X-Cache')).to.eql('HIT'); 

Cookies

In a similar fashion you can test cookies as well.

Cookie exists:

pm.expect(pm.cookies.has('sessionId')).to.be.true; 


Cookie has value:

pm.expect(pm.cookies.get('sessionId')).to.eql(â€™ad3se3ss8sg7sg3');
