Aan de hand van 'https://requestbin.net/' gaan we een URL laten genereren die wij in Postman zullen gebruiken.

notes:
how to change something in the request-url
how to change headers
everything has a body except GET

BODY
- form-data
- raw
- binary
- x-www-form-urlencoded

tip: ctrl + b
> to correct the layout 
-> html

HEADERS
- key predefines header
- you can make your own keys too
- when you insert an 'a' for example, you'll receive a list of keys beginning with 'a'

how to import a complex request from your browser:
- copy URL as cURL
- import > raw text > copy URL

how to inspect HTTP responses:
an HTTP request has 3 parts
- status (is important cause give you an indication if you success was successful are not)
- body (easily inspect it)
- headers (for known headers, postman will give you more information)

you have the possibility to save the response (if you need to document it)

handling cookies:
header > set-cookie (instruct the browser to save this cookie) >
to see existing cookies, postman offers the cookie-manager
format?
adding a cookie
- give a name with a value

when sending a cookie -> cookie-header
when receiving a cookie -> set-cookie header
sorts of request-methods:
- POST
- GET
- PUT
- DELETE
