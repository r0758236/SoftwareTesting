a typical workflow

make a change > export file > commit the file > push change

pros of using GIT:
- free
- history of changes
- all data is stored locally
- code reviews possible
- works well for a few users and when changes are rare

cons of using GIT:
- manual process each time you make a change
- importing/exporting overhead
- reviewing json files is suboptimal
- git conflicts can occur

>> conclusion: 
- try it out if you already know and work with git
- ideal for small teams for individuals
